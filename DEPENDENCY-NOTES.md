As of 2025 March 28:

The `npm outdated` command reports some dependencies as outdated. They are not being updated at this time for the reasons given below:

- `react` / `react-dom`: React is currently tracking the latest v17 versions, as updating to 18 requires significant investment.
- `react-router-dom`: React Router is currently tracking the latest v6 versions because v7 requires React 18.
- `@testing-library/react`: The React Testing Library is currently tracking the latest v12 versions because v13 requires React 18.
- `react-codemirror2`: React CodeMirror is tracking the latest v7 version, as updating to major version v8 requires React 18.
- `codemirror`: CodeMirror is tracking the latest v5 version, as updating to major version v6 requires refactoring.
- `eslint`: ESLint v9 was released recently. However `eslint-plugin-flowtype` still requires ESLint v8. The changes to support v9 are implemented, but not yet released.

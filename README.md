# FSH Online

FSH Online is a web application for authoring [FHIR Shorthand (FSH)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/) and running the [SUSHI](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi) compiler on the authored FSH directly in a web browser. It also runs the [GoFSH](https://github.com/FHIR/GoFSH) decompiler to translate FHIR definitions into FSH. It is available on https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed on the user's system.

In order to install all the required dependencies for the project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, the application can be run in development mode by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/FSHOnline/](http://localhost:5173/FSHOnline/) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. Lint and prettier errors will appear in the console.

## FSH Examples

FSH Online supports easily adding FHIR Shorthand examples that can be viewed in the editor. All examples are kept in the [FSHOnline-Examples repo](https://github.com/FSHSchool/FSHOnline-Examples), and FSH authors are encouraged to submit example FSH files to the FSHOnline-Examples repo.

## NPM Tasks

The following NPM tasks are useful in development.

### Tests

To run the project's tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. For more information, see the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) documentation.

### Lint

To run the linter for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Any issues will be listed. Some issues can be automatically fixed by lint. In order to fix these issues, run the following command:

```

### Build

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the project in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The build will be output to the `dist` folder. This build is minified and can be used to deploy the application. For more information, see Vite's [Building for Production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#building-for-production) documentation and the [build CLI options](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html#build.)

### Serve Build

To serve the built application locally for testing, run the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the built application from the `dist` directory. It will be served on port 4173. You can access it at the following URL: [http://localhost:4173/FSHOnline](http://localhost:4173/FSHOnline).

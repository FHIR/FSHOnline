# FSH Online

FSH Online is a web application for authoring [FHIR Shorthand (FSH)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/) and running the [SUSHI](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi) compiler on the authored FSH directly in a web browser. It also runs the [GoFSH](https://github.com/FHIR/GoFSH) decompiler to translate FHIR definitions into FSH. It is available on https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed on the user's system.

In order to install all the required dependencies for the project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, the application can be run in development mode by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. Lint errors will appear in the console.

## FSH Examples

FSH Online supports easily adding FHIR Shorthand examples that can be viewed in the editor. All examples are kept in the [FSHOnline-Examples repo](https://github.com/FSHSchool/FSHOnline-Examples), and FSH authors are encouraged to submit example FSH files to the FSHOnline-Examples repo.

## NPM Tasks

The following NPM tasks are useful in development.

### Tests

To run the project's tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the Create React App documentation.

### Lint

To run the linter for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Any issues will be listed. Some issues can be automatically fixed by lint. In order to fix these issues, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint-fix
```

### Prettier

To run the prettier code formatting, run the following command:

```bash
npm run prettier
```

### Build

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the project in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The build will be output to the `build` folder. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The build can be used to deploy the application. For more information, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.

### Serve Build

To serve the built application locally for testing, run the following command:

```bash
npm run serve-build
```

This will serve the built application from the `build` directory. It will be served on port 8000. You can access it at the following URL: [http://localhost:8000/FSHOnline/](http://localhost:8000/FSHOnline/).

### Eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

To eject this project, run:

```bash
npm run eject
```

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
